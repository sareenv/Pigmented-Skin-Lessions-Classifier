## Convolutional Neural Network for classification of Pigmented Skin lesions.
<img src = "banner.png" />
The repository contains the experiments with convolutional network architectures and hyper-parameters to find optimal intelligent model to detect pigmented skin lesions. The Research folder contains all the implementation of the model and related tasks such data preparation and image segmentation process. The models are trained using <a link="https://keras.io/"> Keras 2.0 </a> and results are plotted using the matplotlib visualisation libary.

## Required Libraries
<ul>
    <li> Keras 2.0 </li>
    <li> Matplotlib </li>
    <li> Pillow</li>
    <li> Sklearn </li>
    <li> Pandas</li>
    <li> Numpy</li>
</ul>

All the above packages can be installed directly using Anaconda Installer which will also install Jupyter notebooks 
present in the ```Research``` folder. Anaconda downloader can be downloaded from [Download Link](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

## Required Dataset and Configuration
The models can be trained on CPU however, the training speed will be extermly slow, I would recommend to install CUDA libarary which can be used to train the model on GPU for faster processing. The required installation instructions can be found from [Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu)
